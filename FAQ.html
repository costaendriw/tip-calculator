                <h2>General Tipping Questions</h2>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is the standard tip percentage at restaurants?</h3>
                    <p>The standard tip at restaurants in the United States is 15-20% of the pre-tax bill. For good service, 18-20% is appropriate. Exceptional service warrants 20% or more. If service was poor, 10-15% is acceptable, though you should speak with management about serious issues.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Should I tip on the pre-tax or post-tax amount?</h3>
                    <p>Traditionally, tips are calculated on the pre-tax amount. However, calculating on the post-tax total (which is typically only 1-2% higher) is also common and acceptable. The difference is usually negligible, and many people find it easier to tip on the final total shown on their receipt.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do I need to tip on takeout orders?</h3>
                    <p>Tipping on takeout is optional but appreciated. A tip of 10% shows appreciation for the kitchen staff and the person who packaged your order. For large or complex takeout orders, consider tipping 15%. However, unlike dine-in service, there's no strong obligation to tip on takeout.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How much should I tip for food delivery?</h3>
                    <p>Food delivery typically warrants a 15-20% tip, with a minimum of $3-5 regardless of order size. During bad weather, for long distances, or large orders, consider tipping 20-25%. Remember that delivery drivers often use their own vehicles and pay for gas, making tips a significant part of their income.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is it okay to tip less for bad service?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, it's acceptable to reduce your tip for genuinely poor service, but consider the circumstances first. If the restaurant was understaffed or the kitchen was slow, these issues aren't your server's fault. If the poor service was directly due to your server's attitude or inattention, tipping 10-15% and speaking with management is appropriate.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Should I tip if a service charge is already included?</h3>
                    <p>If a service charge or automatic gratuity is already included in your bill (common for large parties), you're not obligated to tip additionally. However, if service was exceptional, adding 5-10% on top of the service charge is a generous gesture that will be appreciated.</p>

                <h2>Bill Splitting Questions</h2>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What's the fairest way to split a bill?</h3>
                    <p>The fairest method depends on your group and situation. For friends who regularly dine together and order similarly, splitting equally is easiest. For groups where people ordered very different amounts, itemized splitting ensures everyone pays for what they ordered. The key is establishing expectations before ordering.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I handle splitting when some people drank alcohol and others didn't?</h3>
                    <p>Separate alcohol costs from food costs. Split the food bill according to your normal method (equally or itemized), then have those who ordered alcohol split those costs among themselves. This approach is fair and prevents non-drinkers from subsidizing expensive drinks they didn't consume.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Should the tip be split equally even if the bill isn't?</h3>
                    <p>When splitting a bill itemized, each person's tip should be proportional to their subtotal. If you ordered $30 worth of food and someone else ordered $60, they should pay twice as much in tip as well. Our calculator handles this automatically when you use the bill splitting feature.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I split the bill for a birthday celebration?</h3>
                    <p>For birthday celebrations, it's customary for guests to split the birthday person's portion. Calculate the total bill, subtract the honoree's meal cost, then divide the remaining amount among the other diners. This way, everyone contributes to treating the guest of honor.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if someone orders much more expensive items than everyone else?</h3>
                    <p>If this is a recurring issue with the same person, address it privately after the meal. Suggest itemized splitting for future dinners. For a one-time occurrence, it depends on the relationship—close friends might let it slide, but acquaintances or colleagues should generally use itemized splitting.</p>

                <h2>Using Our Calculator</h2>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I use the tip calculator?</h3>
                    <p>Using our calculator is simple: Enter your bill amount in the first field, select your desired tip percentage (or enter a custom amount), and specify how many people are splitting the bill. The calculator instantly displays the tip amount, total bill, and per-person cost including tip.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Does the calculator work on mobile devices?</h3>
                    <p>Yes! Our calculator is designed mobile-first and works perfectly on smartphones and tablets. The interface automatically adjusts to your screen size, making it easy to use at the restaurant table when you receive your bill.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I use custom tip percentages?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely. While we provide quick-select buttons for common percentages (15%, 18%, 20%), you can enter any tip percentage you want in the custom field. This is useful for specific situations or when you want to tip an exact amount.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Does the calculator save my preferences?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, the calculator remembers your last settings including your preferred tip percentage. This makes repeated calculations faster since you don't need to reset your preferences each time you use it.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is my data secure when using the calculator?</h3>
                    <p>Your privacy is important to us. All calculations happen directly in your browser—we don't collect, store, or transmit any of the numbers you enter. The calculator works entirely offline once the page loads, ensuring your financial information stays private.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do I need to create an account to use the calculator?</h3>

                <h2>Special Situations</h2>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Should I tip at coffee shops with counter service?</h3>
                    <p>Tipping at coffee shops is appreciated but not mandatory like at sit-down restaurants. If there's a tip jar, adding $0.50-$1 for simple orders or 10-15% for complex drinks is generous. Regular customers often tip more consistently to build rapport with baristas.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How much should I tip for hotel housekeeping?</h3>
                    <p>Tip hotel housekeeping $2-5 per night, left daily rather than at checkout since different staff may service your room each day. Leave the tip in a visible location with a note indicating it's for housekeeping to ensure it reaches the right person.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What about tipping at buffets?</h3>
                    <p>At buffets where you serve yourself, tipping 10% is standard since service is more limited. If a server brings drinks, clears plates frequently, or provides other attentive service, consider tipping 15%. The reduced tip percentage reflects the reduced service compared to traditional dining.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Should I tip less at expensive restaurants?</h3>
                    <p>No, tip percentage should remain consistent regardless of the restaurant's price point. A $200 meal requires the same percentage tip as a $50 meal. The higher absolute amount naturally reflects the more expensive establishment, but the percentage should stay at 15-20% based on service quality.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I tip when using a gift card?</h3>
                    <p>Always tip on the full amount of the meal before the gift card is applied. If your meal costs $60 and you have a $50 gift card, tip on the $60, not the $10 difference you're paying. Servers provided full service regardless of your payment method.</p>

                <h2>International Tipping</h2>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is tipping expected in other countries?</h3>
                    <p>Tipping customs vary dramatically worldwide. In many European countries, service charges are included in the bill, making additional tipping optional. In some Asian countries, tipping can be considered rude. Always research local customs before traveling to avoid cultural missteps.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How much should I tip when traveling abroad?</h3>
                    <p>When traveling, research tipping customs for your specific destination. In countries where tipping is expected, 10% is often sufficient (compared to 15-20% in the US). In countries where service charges are included, rounding up the bill or leaving small change is a polite gesture but not required.</p>
