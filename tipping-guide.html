            <section>
                <h2>Restaurant Tipping Standards</h2>
                <p>Tipping at restaurants remains one of the most common situations where gratuity is expected. The standard tip for good service at a sit-down restaurant is typically between 15% and 20% of the pre-tax bill. However, this can vary based on service quality and location.</p>
                
                <p>For exceptional service, consider tipping 20% or more. If the service was poor, it's acceptable to tip less, but communicate any issues with management first. Remember that servers often share tips with bartenders, hosts, and bussers.</p>

                <h3>Quick Restaurant Tipping Reference:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Excellent service:</strong> 20-25%</li>
                    <li><strong>Good service:</strong> 18-20%</li>
                    <li><strong>Average service:</strong> 15-18%</li>
                    <li><strong>Below average:</strong> 10-15% (speak with manager)</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Delivery and Takeout Tipping</h2>
                <p>Food delivery has become increasingly popular, and tipping etiquette has evolved accordingly. For food delivery services like DoorDash, Uber Eats, or traditional pizza delivery, a tip of 15-20% is standard. However, consider increasing this during bad weather, long distances, or large orders.</p>

                <p>For takeout orders where you pick up the food yourself, tipping is optional but appreciated. A tip of 10% for takeout shows appreciation for the kitchen staff who prepared your meal, especially for large or complex orders.</p>

                <h3>Delivery Tipping Guidelines:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Standard delivery:</strong> 15-20%</li>
                    <li><strong>Bad weather/long distance:</strong> 20-25%</li>
                    <li><strong>Large orders (over $100):</strong> 20% minimum</li>
                    <li><strong>Takeout (pickup):</strong> 10% (optional)</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Hotel and Travel Tipping</h2>
                <p>When staying at hotels, multiple staff members may deserve tips for their service. Housekeeping should receive $2-5 per night, left daily rather than at the end of your stay since different staff may service your room each day.</p>

                <p>Bellhops typically receive $1-2 per bag they carry. Concierges should be tipped $5-20 depending on the complexity of the service they provide. For simple directions, no tip is necessary, but for securing hard-to-get reservations or tickets, a larger tip is appropriate.</p>

                <h3>Hotel Staff Tipping:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Housekeeping:</strong> $2-5 per night</li>
                    <li><strong>Bellhop:</strong> $1-2 per bag</li>
                    <li><strong>Concierge:</strong> $5-20 based on service</li>
                    <li><strong>Valet:</strong> $2-5 when retrieving car</li>
                    <li><strong>Room service:</strong> 15-20% if not included</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Personal Services Tipping</h2>
                <p>Personal service providers like hairstylists, barbers, nail technicians, and massage therapists generally expect tips of 15-20%. For exceptional service or if you're a regular client, consider tipping 20-25%.</p>

                <p>If you receive services from multiple people (for example, a shampoo assistant and a stylist), you should tip each person individually. A good rule is to give the main service provider 15-20% and assistants $3-5 each.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Regional Differences in Tipping</h2>
                <p>Tipping customs vary significantly by country and even by region within countries. In the United States, tipping is expected and often forms a significant portion of service workers' income. In many European countries, service charges are included in the bill, making additional tipping optional.</p>

                <p>When traveling internationally, research local tipping customs beforehand. In some cultures, tipping can even be considered offensive, while in others, it's expected at higher rates than in the US.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>When Not to Tip</h2>
                <p>While tipping is important, there are situations where it's not expected or necessary. Counter service at coffee shops or fast-food restaurants doesn't typically require tips, though tip jars are often available for those who wish to show appreciation.</p>

                <p>For services where you're charged a flat rate by professionals (like lawyers, doctors, or accountants), tipping is not appropriate. Additionally, if a mandatory service charge or gratuity is already included in your bill, you're not obligated to tip extra unless you received exceptional service.</p>
